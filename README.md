## About

A Tampermonkey userscript to provide a button for easily getting the post's
photographs or videos from the web app.

## Usage

When installed, the script will render the logo next to the web app's own logo
(that's how you'll know it's working).
A dedicated button will then be appended to every post, so you can't miss it.
